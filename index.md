# Kubernetes: Up and Running

This repository contains informal notes that I created while reading
[Kubernetes: Up and Running](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-up-and/9781492046523/)
book by Brendan Burns, Joe Beda, Kelsey Hightower.

These notes are no way a summary of the book. I have a habit of writing
some interesting bits down while reading a technical book. These notes
are just collection of such interesting bits.

Go read the book yourself!
